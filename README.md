SwiftIB
=======

SwiftIB is a pure Swift implementation of the [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) [TWS API](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/api/api.htm) library on Mac OS X, with Core Foundation of crouse. All the API interfaces are implemented. `Request Market Data` and `Request History Data` interface are thoroughly tested.

Along with SwiftIB there are `HistoryDataDump` and `MktDataDump` command line applications as references for using SwiftIB library. Currently SwiftIB does not support static linking, and command line applications cannot use Framework distribution conveniently. So these tools are compiled with SwiftIB sources directly. 

Should you have any suggestion or comments, the author will be glad to hear them ðŸ˜„
